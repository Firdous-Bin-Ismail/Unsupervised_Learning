# Unsupervised_Learning

(Used make_blobs dataset from sklearn.datasets)

1. Implemented K-Means clustering for grouping data.

2. Compared results with DBSCAN to highlight differences in cluster formation.

3. Applied PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

-> Evaluated and visualized clustering performance to show clear distinctions between algorithms.

-> The project demonstrates how different clustering techniques behave on the same dataset.
